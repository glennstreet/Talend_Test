Here we are adding a generated jar directory to the sourceSets.  This directory contains a generated
zip file from Talend. Because taland generates the java code this falls outside of our standard process.
At some point we could re-visit the rup-application plugin and try to fit this type of process into the 
standard java app framwork.  For now this seemed like the cheapest solution.
